<h1>The Impact of the Tech Boom on San Francisco</h1>

<p>The tech boom of the late twentieth century had a profound impact on the city of San Francisco and its surrounding areas. Young, college educated technology workers poured into the area from around the country, and with them came both positive and negative effects. The local economy swelled and many high paying jobs formed, yet with these benefits came rent increases that drove out some of the city's residents. The result was a city that appeared to have two distinct classes: The wealthier and more educated in San Francisco got richer as time went on, yet the city became inhospitable to its poorer residents.</p>
<p>This exhibit will take a closer look at both the positive and negative effects that the tech boom had on the population of San Francisco by tracking multiple quantitative measures such as household income, education level, and monthly rent across the time period of 1980 to 2010. We will observe that as the twentieth century came to a close, the value of these quantities in San Francisco begins to sharply diverge from the rest of California. This exhibit will also consider the impact that computer specialists and those in other technical occupations had on these trends by observing how these quantitative measures vary with occupation.</p>
<p>Additionally, this exhibit includes archived news articles from the time of the tech bubble, providing first-hand accounts of its impact on life in San Francisco and the Bay Area according to individuals ranging from construction workers to tech CEOs. With a combination of detailed quantitative measures and first-hand accounts, this exhibit aims to provide as accurate a picture as possible of the impact that the tech boom had on San Francisco.

<h2>Exhibit 1: Income in SF and CA During the Tech Boom</h2>
<img src="img/income.png" width="40%">
<p>This plot shows the median income for both the city of San Francisco and the entire state of California for census years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. We can see that the median income in San Francisco was not notably different than the rest of California until the 1990s, after which income in San Francisco started to outpace the rest of the state. This gap widens as time goes on, and appears to coincide with the time period of the dot-com boom.</p>
<p>This plot was generated in Python 3 using the libraries "numpy" and "matplotlib", with census data provided by IPUMS USA.</p>

<h2>Exhibit 2: Maps of Income Increase in SF</h2>

<img src="img/image-11.png" width="31%">
<p>These three maps show the distributions of per capita income in San Francisco for the census years 1980, 1990, and 2000 respectively. We can see that as the tech boom occured, the concentration of high incomes went up considerably.</p>
<p>These maps were generated using Social Explorer, with US census data.</p>

<h2>Exhibit 3: Education in SF and CA During the Tech Boom</h2>
<img src="img/education.png" width="40%" class="center">
<p>This plot shows the proportion of adults with four or more years of college education for both the city of San Francisco and the entire state of California for census years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. We can see that although San Francisco always had a higher proportion of college educated adults than than rest of California during this period, this gap widened considerably during the 1990s and 2000s as more college educated workers arrived in the city for tech jobs.</p>

<h2>Exhibit 4: Rise of Computer Occupations in SF and CA During the Tech Boom</h2>
<img src="img/computer.png" width="40%">
<p>This plot shows the proportion of adults who have a computer occupation for both the city of San Francisco and the entire state of California for census years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. We define a computer occupation as any job falling under the category of “Computer and Mathematical Occupations” in the list of <a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/occ_acs.shtml">ACS Occupation Codes</a>. We can see that between 1990 and 2000, the proportion of computer specialists in San Francisco shot ahead of the rest of the state before leveling off.</p>
<p>This plot was generated in Python 3 using the libraries "numpy" and "matplotlib", with census data provided by IPUMS USA.</p>

<h2>Exhibit 5: Income Controlled for Occupation in SF During the Tech Boom</h2>
<img src="img/computer_vs_other.png" width="40%">
<p>This plot shows the median household income in the city of San Francisco for census years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, where individuals are categorized depending on whether or not they have a computer occupation. We have previously seen that median household income in San Francisco rose at a much greater rate than in California as a whole after the 1990s. This plot demonstrates that this divergence is due in part to the relative increase in wages of computer occupations during that period.</p>
