        <h4>Rigetti Computing</h4>
        <em>May 2017 - August 2017 (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Software Engineer Intern</em>
        <p>This Summer I interned at <a href="http://www.rigetti.com">Rigetti Computing</a>, a quantum computing startup out of Berkeley and Fremont. I developed a Python library (<a href="https://pyquil.readthedocs.io">pyquil.readthedocs.io</a>) that allows users to construct Quil (Quantum Instruction Language) programs and run them on an in-house Quantum Processing Unit over the cloud.</p>
        <p>I also wrote and deployed an interactive website (<a href="http://demo.rigetti.com">demo.rigetti.com</a>) to demonstrate the ability of quantum algorithms to approximate solutions to NP-complete problems, and deployed a large-scale data lake to AWS servers in order to store readout values from the calibration of the in-house control systems.</p>

        <h4>Lawrence Berkeley National Lab</h4>
        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Research Apprentice</em>
        <p>I'm part of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's "ATLAS Analysis Team", which works with data brought in from the <a href="http://atlas.cern">ATLAS Experiment</a> at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I write data analysis modules in C++ for ROOT (CERN's object oriented framework for large scale data analysis) in order to resolve issues of detector performance, efficiency, and alignment.</p>
        <p>My current research at LBNL is on applying topics in machine learning in order to train a neural network designed to identify charged particles resulting from collisions in the ATLAS detector. Previously, I developed a method for extracting exclusive quark/gluon probablity distributions from mixed particle jets meaured at the LHC (descibed on the "Projects" page).</p>

        <h4>UC Berkeley EECS Department</h4>
        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Student Instructor</em>
        <p>I teach a section for Computer Science 70 (Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory), in which I meet twice per week with a group of fifty lower division students and lecture on the course material. I also hold office hours, hold homework parties, grade exams, and help maintain the course <a href="http://www.eecs70.org">website</a>.</p>
        <p>I was previously an Academic Intern for Computer Science 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs), where I led the lab component of the course each week and held weekly office hours.</p>

        <h4>Upsilon Pi Epsilon, Nu Chapter</h4>
        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Professional Development Committee</em>
        <p>I'm on the Professional Development committee of the Nu Chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the national computer science honor society. My responsibilities include holding office hours, resume critiques, and mock interviews. In previous semesters I was on the Industrial Relations committee, in which I acted as a liason for tech companies looking to hold info-sessions and recruit on the Berkeley campus.</p>

        <h4>Activity Assist</h4>
        <em>October 2016 - January 2017 (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Web Developer</em>
        <p>Last Fall I was a web developer for Activity Assist, a student-run edutech startup out of UC Berkeley and UI Urbana-Champaign. I wrote backend rails code, found and remedied UI bugs, and recruited for the Berkeley team.</p>
