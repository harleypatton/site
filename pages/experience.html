        <em>Software Engineer Intern</em>
        <p>I am one of 10 developers who design, build, and run MIT's largest and longest running programming competition. With over 3000 participants and 1000 teams each year, I assist in designing the game, and I also lead the development of the website.</p>

        <em>Research Apprentice</em>
        <p>I'm part of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's "ATLAS Analysis Team", which works with data brought in from the <a href="http://atlas.cern">ATLAS Experiment</a> at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I write data analysis modules in C++ for ROOT (CERN's object oriented framework for large scale data analysis) in order to resolve issues of detector performance, efficiency, and alignment.</p>
        <p>My current research at LBNL is on applying topics in machine learning in order to train a neural network designed to identify charged particles resulting from collisions in the ATLAS detector. Previously, I developed a method for extracting exclusive quark/gluon probablity distributions from mixed particle jets meaured at the LHC (descibed on the "Projects" page).</p>

        <em>Student Instructor</em>
        <p>I teach a section for Computer Science 70 (Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory), in which I meet twice per week with a group of fifty lower division students and lecture on the course material. I also hold office hours, hold homework parties, grade exams, and help maintain the course <a href="http://www.eecs70.org">website</a>.</p>
        <p>I was previously an Academic Intern for Computer Science 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs), where I lead the lab component of the course each week and held weekly office hours.</p>
