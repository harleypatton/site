        <em>Software Development Engineer Intern</em>
        <p>This Summer I'm interning on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/translate/">Amazon Translate</a> group on the AWS Deep Learning team. More info to come!

        <em>Research Apprentice</em>
        <p>I'm part of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's ATLAS Analysis Team, which works with data brought in from the <a href="http://atlas.cern">ATLAS Experiment</a> at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I've worked on the following projects over the last two years:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Training generative adverserial networks to simulate the effects of particle collision events in a way indistinguishable from the events measured at CERN, motivated by the fact that feed-forward networks are much more efficient than the current state-of-the-art simulators.</li>
            <li>Developed a heuristic that can be used to classify particles from measured energy-loss readouts. I showed that a classifier using this hueristic performs as well an artificial neural network, and proved its optimality. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08974">arXiv</a>)</li>
            <li>Developed a method for extracting exclusive quark/gluon probablity distributions from mixed particle jets measured at CERN. (<a href="papers/Exclusive Quark and Gluon Jet Properties.pdf">slides</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Student Instructor</em>
        <p>I am currently a student instructor for <a href="http://cs170.org">Computer Science 170</a> (Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems), and was awarded the 2017-2018 <a href="http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/">Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award</a> for my effectiveness in this role. My responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teaching a discussion section of 50 students how to think about and develop algorithms (dynamic programming, linear programming and optimization, paths in graphs, streaming algorithms, cryptography, coping with NP-Completeness).</li>
            <li>Leading development of the course's final project, which includes creating solvers, internal documentation, and a cloud autograding framework that can handle requests from over 700 students.</li>
            <li>Holding office hours, holding homework parties, and grading exams.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prior to this, I had similar roles in the courses <a href="http://eecs70.org">Computer Science 70</a> (Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory) and <a href="http://cs61a.org">Computer Science 61A</a> (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs).</p>

        <em>May 2017 - August 2017 (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Software Engineer Intern</em>
        <p>Last Summer I interned at <a href="http://www.rigetti.com">Rigetti Computing</a>, a quantum computing startup out of Berkeley and Fremont. I worked on the following projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contributed to python libraries (<a href="https://pyquil.readthedocs.io">pyQuil</a> and <a href="http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io">Grove</a>) that allow users to connect to and run programs on in-house Quantum Processing Units over the cloud.
            <li>Wrote and deployed an interactive website to demonstrate the ability of quantum algorithms to find approximate solutions to NP-complete problems.</li>
            <li>Deployed a data lake to AWS servers in order to store readout values from control system calibrations. </li>
        </ul>

        <em>Professional Development Committee</em>
        <p>I'm on the Professional Development committee of the Nu Chapter of <a href="http://upe.acm.org">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>, the national computer science honor society. My responsibilities include holding office hours, resume critiques, and mock interviews. In previous semesters I was on the Industrial Relations committee, in which I acted as a liason for tech companies looking to hold info-sessions and recruit on the Berkeley campus.</p>
