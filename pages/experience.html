        <em>Software Development Engineer Intern</em>
        <p>This Summer I'm interning on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/translate/">Amazon Translate</a> group on Amazon Web Service's Deep Learning Team. More info to come!

        <em>May 2017 - August 2017 (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Software Engineer Intern</em>
        <p>Last Summer I interned at <a href="http://www.rigetti.com">Rigetti Computing</a>, a quantum computing startup out of Berkeley and Fremont. I contributed to a Python library (<a href="https://pyquil.readthedocs.io">pyquil.readthedocs.io</a>) that allows users to construct <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355">Quil</a> (Quantum Instruction Language) programs and run them on an in-house Quantum Processing Unit over the cloud.</p>
        <p>I also wrote and deployed an interactive website (<a href="http://demo.rigetti.com">demo.rigetti.com</a>) to demonstrate the ability of quantum algorithms to approximate solutions to NP-complete problems, and deployed a large-scale data lake to AWS servers in order to store readout values from the calibration of the in-house control systems.</p>

        <h4>Lawrence Berkeley National Lab</h4>
        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Research Apprentice</em>
        <p>I'm part of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's ATLAS Analysis Team, which works with data brought in from the <a href="http://atlas.cern">ATLAS Experiment</a> at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I write data analysis modules in C++ for ROOT (CERN's object oriented framework for large scale data analysis) in order to resolve issues of detector performance, efficiency, and alignment.</p>
        <p>My current research at LBNL is on applying topics in machine learning in order to train a neural network designed to identify charged particles resulting from collisions in the ATLAS detector. Previously, I developed a method for extracting exclusive quark/gluon probablity distributions from mixed particle jets meaured at the LHC (descibed on the "Projects" page).</p>

        <h4>UC Berkeley EECS Department</h4>
        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Student Instructor</em>
        <p>I teach a discussion section for <a href="http://cs170.org">Computer Science 170</a> (Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems), in which I meet weekly with a group of fifty lower division students and lecture on the course material. I also hold office hours, hold homework parties, and grade exams. I have been an instructor for this course since January 2018.</p>
        <p>I had this same role for the course <a href="http://eecs70.org">Computer Science 70</a> (Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory) from January 2017 to December 2017. Prior to that, I was an Academic Intern for <A href="http://cs61a.org">Computer Science 61A</a> (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs), where I led the lab component of the course each week and held weekly office hours.</p>
        <p>I was awarded the 2017-2018 <a href="http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/">Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award</a> for my effectiveness in these roles.</p>

        <h4>Upsilon Pi Epsilon, Nu Chapter</h4>
        <em>August 2016 - Present (Berkeley, CA)</em><br />
        <em>Professional Development Committee</em>
        <p>I'm on the Professional Development committee of the Nu Chapter of <a href="http://upe.acm.org">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>, the national computer science honor society. My responsibilities include holding office hours, resume critiques, and mock interviews. In previous semesters I was on the Industrial Relations committee, in which I acted as a liason for tech companies looking to hold info-sessions and recruit on the Berkeley campus.</p>
