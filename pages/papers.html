<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08974.pdf">The Optimal Use of Silicon Pixel Charge Information for Particle Identification</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton, Benjamin Nachman</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">I developed a heuristic that can be used to classify particle types (pion, kaon, proton) based off of the energy-loss readouts that they leave in the ATLAS detector at CERN following proton-proton collisions. I showed that a classifier using this hueristic outperforms the previous standard, and proved its optimality.

<h2>Talks</h2>

<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="papers/Shor's.pdf">Shor's Prime Factorization Algorithm</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">I gave a talk at the Bay Area Quantum Computing Meetup in August of 2017. I described the math behind Shor's Algorithm, described the impact it will have on modern cryptosystems, and demonstrated a toy example that can be run on today's hardware.

<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="papers/Exclusive Quark and Gluon Jet Properties.pdf">Exclusive Quark and Gluon Jet Properties</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton, Benjamin Nachman</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">I gave a talk at the ATLAS annual meeting at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in January of 2017. I presented a regression model I designed to estimate three-dimensional distributions of particle jets measured at CERN.
