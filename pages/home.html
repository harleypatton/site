<h2>Hello there!</h2>

<p id="home-intro">Welcome to my website!</p>

<p id="about-me-home">I'm Harley Patton, a fourth year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley. I currently work as a student instructor teaching computer security at Berkeley, and in June 2019 I'll be starting as a software engineer at Google. I'm a biking enthusiast, an avid reader, and a jazz saxophonist. Click on the links on the left to learn more!</p>

            <p class="blog-caption">A paper I wrote with a colleague at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in which we derive a heuristic that can be used to distinguish particle types from the energy-loss reaouts they leave in the ATLAS detector at CERN.

            <p class="blog-caption">A talk I gave at the Bay Area Quantum Computing Meetup in August of 2017, describing the math behind Shor's Algorithm, the impact it will have on modern cryptosystems, and demonstrating a toy example that can be run on today's hardware.

            <p class="blog-caption">A talk I gave at the ATLAS annual meeting at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in January of 2017. I presented a regression model I designed to estimate three-dimensional distributions of particle jets measured at CERN.
