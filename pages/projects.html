        <h3>Optimal Particle Identification</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I developed a heuristic that can be used to classify particle types (pion, kaon, proton) based off of the energy-loss readouts that they leave in the ATLAS detector at CERN following proton-proton collisions. I showed that a classifier using this heuristic outperforms the previous standard, and proved its optimality.</p>
        <p class="proj-info">Read the paper at <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08974.pdf">arXiv:1803.08974</a>, and see the code <a href="https://github.com/LBNLPixelProjects/OptimalParticleIdentification/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Quark/Gluon Regression Model</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I worked with Dr. <a href="https://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/">Ben Nachman</a> to design and implement a regression model for extracting exclusive quark and gluon probability distributions from mixed particle jets resulting from proton-proton collisons measured at the ATLAS particle detector at CERN. I demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on particle-level data simulated in Pythia 8 (particle simulator) by the ATLAS Monte Carlo, running on NERSC (National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center) supercomputers.</p>
        <p class="proj-info">See my presentation <a href="http://harleypatton.com/papers/Exclusive%20Quark%20and%20Gluon%20Jet%20Properties.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Quantum Algorithms</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">While working at Rigetti Computing as a Software Engineer Intern, I helped to develop quantum algorithms using their open source platform <a href="http://www.rigetti.com/index.php/forest">Forest</a>. I implemented algorithms such as Shor's Algorithm, the Duestch-Jozsa Algorithm, arbitrary state generation, and more. I also built a website to demonstrate the power of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to find approximate solutions to NP-complete problems.</p>

        <h3>Letter Classifier</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">The introduction to machine learning course at UC Berkeley hosted a Kaggle competition, in which each student in the course wrote a neural net to classify handwritten letters from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a> dataset. My implementation utilized ReLU activation in the hidden layers and a softmax output layer, regularized with L2 and dropout. It scored a testing accuracy 1.327% higher than that of the course staff. </p>

        <h3>Enigma</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I wrote a computer simulation of the German M4 Enigma Machine used to encrypt messages during World War II. It recreates the full Enigma system used by the German Navy, consisting of eight moving rotors, two fixed rotors, and two reflectors. It implements a progressive substitution cipher, allowing for 614,175,744 unique possible encryptions for any text string.</p>
