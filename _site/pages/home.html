<h2>Hello there!</h2>

<p id="home-intro">Welcome to my website!</p>

<p id="about-me-home">I'm currently a third year undergraduate at UC Berkeley, double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathmatics. My interests include machine learning, cryptography, and quantum computing. I work as a researcher for CERN through Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and as a student instructor for the UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department. I'm a member of the Nu Chapter of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Computing Sciences Honor Society, and a brother at the Cal Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon. I'm a biking enthusiast, an avid reader, and a jazz saxophonist. Click on the links on the left to learn more!</p>
