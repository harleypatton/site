        <h3>Quark/Gluon Regression Model</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I worked with <a href="https://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/">Dr. Ben Nachman</a> to design and implement a regression model for extracting exclusive quark and gluon probablity distributions from mixed particle jets resulting from proton-proton collisons measured at the ATLAS particle detector at CERN. I demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on particle-level data simulated in Pythia 8 (particle simulator) by the ATLAS Monte Carlo, running on NERSC (National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center) supercomputers.</p>

        <h3>Particle Classifier</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I am currently working to create a classifier to distinguish pion, kaon, and proton tracks recorded in the ATLAS detector at CERN. I am using measurements of the stopping power acting on charged particles in different layers of the ATLAS Pixel detecors as features to train a neural network to distinguish the tracks left by different particle types, with the intention of using this classifier to model particle fragmentation functions outside of the range of our standard tools.</p>

        <h3>Facelift</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">My friends <a href="https://github.com/richardzhu">Richard</a>, <a href="https://joelin0.github.io">Joe<a/>, <a href="https://github.com/vontell">Aaron</a>, and I built a web application that adds imperceptible noise to photos that contain faces in order to cause deep facial recognition algorithms (such as Facebook's <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ranzato/publications/taigman_cvpr14.pdf">DeepFace</a>) to misclassify, allowing users to protect their privacy online. We use classic Haar-cascade based algorithms to detect and segment possible faces, and a projected gradient descent based targeted adversarial attack to disguise the face once it is detected.</p>
        <p class="proj-info">Demo coming soon!</a></p>

        <h3>TAQOS and QStudio</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">My friend <a href="https://github.com/vontell">Aaron</a> and I have begun putting together a suite of tools to make quantum programming more accessible to researchers and the general public. TAQOS (Technology Agnostic Quantum Operating System) is an open-source collection of abstracted modules which use specific drivers and hardware implementations to run quantum information experiments. Over the course of the next few months, our technology will be integrated into some of the control systems at the <a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/qp/">MIT Quantum Photonics Lab</a>. Our suite also includes QStudio, a quantum circuit IDE and learning resource.</p>
        <p class="proj-info">See the TAQOS code (so far) at <a href="https://github.com/TAQOS/TAQOS">github.com/TAQOS/TAQOS</a>, and check out the QStudio website at <a href="http://www.qstudio.io">qstudio.io</a>.</p>

        <h3>Quantum Algorithms</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">While working at Rigetti Computing as a Software Engineer Intern, I helped to develop quantum algorithms using their open source platform <a href="http://www.rigetti.com/index.php/forest">Forest</a>. I implemented algorithms such as Shor's Algorithm, the Duestch-Jozsa Algorithm, arbitrary state generation, and more. I also built a website to demonstrate the power of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to find approximate solutions to NP-complete problems.</p>
        <p class="proj-info">See my contributions at <a href="https://github.com/rigetticomputing/grove">github.com/rigetticomputing/grove</a>, and check out the demo at <a href="http://demo.rigetti.com">demo.rigetti.com</a>.

        <h3>Letter Classifier</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">The introduction to machine learning course at UC Berkeley hosted a Kaggle competition, in which each student in the course wrote a neural net to classify handwritten letters from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a> dataset. My implementation utilized ReLU activation in the hidden layers and a softmax output layer, regularized with L2 and dropout. It scored a testing accuracy 1.327% higher than that of the course staff. </p>

        <h3>Enigma</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I wrote a computer simulation of the German M4 Enigma Machine used to encrypt messages during World War II. It recreates the full Enigma system used by the German Navy, consisting of eight moving rotors, two fixed rotors, and two reflectors. It implements a progressive substitution cipher, allowing for 614,175,744 unique possible encryptions for any text string.</p>

        <h3>BearMaps</h3>
        <p class="proj-caption">I wrote the back end of a mapping program rendering the UC Berkeley campus and surrounding area, using data pulled from OpenStreetMap. It finds the shortest path from source to destination using the A* search algorithm.</p>
