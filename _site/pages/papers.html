<h2>Talks and Papers</h2>
<p id="paper-intro">Below is a collection of my talks and papers. These are either related to my research or classes, and sometimes my personal interests. Papers in the "unpublished" section are simply summaries of my work, and do not represent the work or opinions of the secondary authors.</p><br />

<h2>Talks</h2>
<hr />
<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="../papers/Shor's.pdf">Shor's Prime Factorization Algorithm</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">I gave a talk at the Bay Area Quantum Computing Meetup in August of 2017. I described the math behind Shor's Algorithm, described the impact it will have on modern cryptosystems, and demonstrated a toy example that can be run on today's hardware.

<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="../papers/Exclusive Quark and Gluon Jet Properties.pdf">Exclusive Quark and Gluon Jet Properties</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton, Ben Nachman</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">I gave a talk at the ATLAS annual meeting at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in January of 2017. I presented a regression model I designed with <a href="https://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/">Dr. Ben Nachman</a> that we used to estimate three-dimensional distributions of particle jets measured at CERN.

<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="../papers/QSVM.pdf">Quantum Support Vector Machines: An Algorithmic Analysis</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton, Rob Giometti, Vijitha Sridhar, Marcus Lee</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">As a project for Computer Science C191 (Quantum Computation and Information Science) at UC Berkeley, my classmates and I wrote a short paper on how quantum computation could offer a significant speedup to the training time of support vector machines.

<h3 class="pub-title"><a target="_blank" href="../papers/intern-review.pdf">Rigetti Intern Summary</a></h3>

<p class="pub-info"><em>Harley Patton</em></p>
<p class="pub-desc">After my internship at Rigetti Computing over the Summer of 2017, I wrote up a summary of the projects that myself and some of the other software interns worked on.
